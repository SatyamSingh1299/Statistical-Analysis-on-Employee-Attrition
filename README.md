# Statistical-Analysis-on-Employee-Attrition
Exploratory Data Analysis

Executives at this company have hired you as a data science consultant to identify the factors that lead 
to employees leaving their company. They would like for you to do an initial data analysis that is able to 
provide insights on the likelihood of an employee leaving their company to make recommendations on 
how to minimize this behaviour.

Specifically, the broad questions that the executive team is trying to answer include:

1. What are the factors that contribute to employees leaving the company based on summary 
statistics?

2. Without running any predictive models, just by using plots, can you provide insights for 
the top management?
